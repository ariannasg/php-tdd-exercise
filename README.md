Develop better software with less bugs, and save more time for developing new features, with test-driven development.

This course takes developers from writing their first unit test in PHPUnit to improving code coverage in their applications. Justin Yost covers writing test doubles to deal with dependencies in software, writing exception-based tests, and rapidly adding test cases to the core suite of unit tests. Developers will come away with a basic understanding of the test-driven development (TDD) cycle and understand how to use unit tests to write code, as well as refactor legacy code.
